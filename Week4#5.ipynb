Iterator is an object which allows a programmer to traverse through all the elements of a collection, regardless of its specific implementation. \n","    - In Python, an iterator object implements two methods, `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.\n","    - String, List or Tuple objects can be used to create an Iterator.\n","\n","* Generator\n","    - Function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method\n","    - When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution of the function. \n","    - When the `__next()__` method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches the yield statement, which returns the yielded value. \n","    - The yield keeps track i.e. remembers the last execution and the second `__next()__` call continues from previous value."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":248},"id":"25WtAZpl8DQX","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1616836445236,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":877,"user":{"displayName":"Prince","photoUrl":"","userId":"13948313668249168316"}},"outputId":"6274c00e-dabd-4645-c945-c22e02b76573"},"source":["mytuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","myit = iter(mytuple)\n","\n","print(next(myit))\n","print(next(myit))\n","print(next(myit))\n","print(next(myit))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["apple\n","banana\n","cherry\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"error","ename":"StopIteration","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mStopIteration\u001b[0m                             Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-28-b591aa91f767>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnext\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mmyit\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnext\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mmyit\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 7\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnext\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mmyit\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mStopIteration\u001b[0m: "]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qjAL5W_X9kB7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1616836686926,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":937,"user":{"displayName":"Prince","photoUrl":"","userId":"13948313668249168316"}},"outputId":"25702477-1b0d-4fdb-becb-65285b182c00"},"source":["def simpleGeneratorFunc():\n","    yield 1\n","    yield 2\n","    yield 3\n","   \n","# x is a generator object\n","x = simpleGeneratorFunc()\n","  \n","# Iterating over the generator object using next\n","print(x.__next__()) # In Python 3, __next__()\n","print(next(x))\n","print(next(x))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1\n","2\n","3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"keU1YHbz-azX"},"source":["# A simple generator for Fibonacci Numbers\n","def fib(limit):\n","      \n","    # Initialize first two Fibonacci Numbers \n","    a, b = 0, 1\n","  \n","    # One by one yield next Fibonacci Number\n","    while a < limit:\n","        yield a\n","        a, b = b, a + b\n","  \n","# Create a generator object\n","x = fib(5)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FneC_MX0_Mqj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1616836920808,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2229,"user":{"displayName":"Prince","photoUrl":"","userId":"13948313668249168316"}},"outputId":"c41bfff6-fd93-4d5a-ef80-319d14db968f"},"source":["# Iterating over the generator object using next\n","print(next(x))\n","print(next(x))\n","print(next(x))\n","print(next(x))\n","print(next(x))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["0\n","1\n","1\n","2\n","3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Uucd2OKd_VKU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1616836921796,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1198,"user":{"displayName":"Prince","photoUrl":"","userId":"13948313668249168316"}},"outputId":"6ca064d5-20ad-4a6a-daaf-19bdccef5817"},"source":["# Iterating over the generator object using for\n","# in loop.\n","print(\"\\nUsing for in loop\")\n","for i in fib(5): \n","    print(i)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n","Using for in loop\n","0\n","1\n","1\n","2\n","3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
