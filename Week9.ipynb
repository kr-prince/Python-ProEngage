Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. Some of the key terminologies are:\n","\n","* __Class −__ A user-defined prototype(or a \"blueprint\") that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n","\n","* __Class variable −__ A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n","\n","* __Data member −__ A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n","\n","* __Function overloading −__ The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n","\n","* __Instance variable −__ A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n","\n","* __Inheritance −__ The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n","\n","* __Instance −__ An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n","\n","* __Instantiation −__ The creation of an instance of a class.\n","\n","* __Method −__ A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n","\n","* __Object −__ A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n","\n","* __Operator overloading −__ The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mY1J3GpmmrvJ"},"source":["### Classes and Attributes"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hoIVp63_kuks","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620463522043,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1257,"user":{"displayName":"Prince","photoUrl":"","userId":"13948313668249168316"}}},"source":["class ClassName:\n","   \"\"\"Optional class documentation string.
